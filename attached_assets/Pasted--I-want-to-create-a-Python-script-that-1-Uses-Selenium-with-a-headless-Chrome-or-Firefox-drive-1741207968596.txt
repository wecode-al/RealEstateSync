# I want to create a Python script that:
# 1. Uses Selenium (with a headless Chrome or Firefox driver) to automate form-filling on the following property listing sites:
#    - njoftime.com
#    - njoftime.al
#    - merrjep.al
#    - mirliri.com
#    - indomino
#    - okazion.al
#
# 2. I want the script to:
#    - Prompt me (or read from a config file) for the property details:
#       * title
#       * description
#       * price
#       * location
#       * contact information
#       * images to upload (if possible)
#    - Log in to each website (if login is required) using credentials I store in a config file or environment variables.
#    - Fill in the property listing form fields and submit the listing.
#    - Wait for a success message or listing URL to confirm the post was successful.
#    - Print a summary of the results: which sites got posted successfully, which failed, etc.
#
# 3. For each site, I understand the HTML form fields and site layouts are different. Provide placeholder code sections or functions for:
#    - Logging in (if needed)
#    - Navigating to the "post new listing" page
#    - Filling in form fields (title, description, price, images)
#    - Handling captcha if it appears (at least mention it or provide a way to pause for manual captcha solve)
#
# 4. Include comments or docstrings that explain how I can:
#    - Modify the code to add or remove fields
#    - Update selectors (like By.ID, By.NAME, By.XPATH) if the site changes its layout
#    - Configure environment variables or a JSON file for credentials
#
# 5. Provide instructions on how to install and run this Selenium script in Replit:
#    - Which packages I need in 'pyproject.toml' or 'requirements.txt'
#    - How to set up ChromeDriver or a headless browser in Replit
#    - Show how to actually launch the script (e.g., "python main.py")
#
# 6. Show best practices for error handling, such as:
#    - Try/Except blocks around the login step
#    - Handling timeouts or missing elements
#    - Logging or printing a message if something fails
#
# 7. Please produce a well-structured Python script with functions like:
#    - post_to_njoftime_com(driver, property_details)
#    - post_to_njoftime_al(driver, property_details)
#    - post_to_merrjep_al(driver, property_details)
#    - etc.
#
# 8. Provide an overall 'main' function that:
#    - Reads user input or a JSON config for property details and credentials
#    - Initiates the Selenium driver
#    - Calls each siteâ€™s posting function
#    - Closes the driver when done
#
# 9. If there's anything that might violate the Terms of Service of these sites,
#    please include a short disclaimer about it and mention that we should check the ToS.
#
# Finally, generate the Python script. I'll refine or test it after you provide the initial version.
